Sakila Movie Rental Database
I'll be analyzing the Sakila Rental Movie database in SQL. They are a chain of movie rental stores. Consists of numerous tables which includes extensive information like movies, customers, rentals, actors etc. My objective is to analyze what kind of movies are most often rented, which genres they belong to, and which actors appear in them.
